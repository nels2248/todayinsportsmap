# todayinsportsmap
This repository is the central spot that I will be used to maintain code where I want to be able to show
all of the days sports one one map.  It will be involving.

Status as of April 22, 2023.  Have only the soccer games from espn scraped with beaitiful soup and displayed
on a folium map.  I also have been using pythonanywhere.com to host a live version of this that refreshes nightly here.
